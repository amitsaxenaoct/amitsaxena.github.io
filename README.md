## Data Science Projects

Hi All- I'm creating this repository to store the projects I completed while doing my Masters in Data Science.

Here's the list of projects collected in this repository-

1.	Project 1.1- Impact of Covid on Our Eating & Drinking Habits: In this project I did the initial analysis of COVID-19’s impact on our eating and drinking habits. I prepared a list of certain key words I thought would be, directly or indirectly, related. Then I explored the trends of those terms and came to an initial conclusion that Covid has adversely impacted our eating and drinking habits.

2.	Project 1.2- Impact of Covid on Our Eating & Drinking Habits: In this project I conducted an analysis of coronavirus’ impact on our eating and drinking habits.

3.	Project 2- Weather Search by City & Zip: In this project I created a program which asks the user to enter the City or ZIP code for which they want to find the weather. I used an open weather API to query the data.

4.	Project 3- Analysis on NFL Players: In this project I focused on how the NFL players have evolved over the years by making comparisons between retired and active NFL players.

5.	Project 4- NFL Data Exploration: In this project I researched the data of NFL players and tried to find out the traits which are common to NFL players. I explored the data I found on Kaggle and created trends and visualizations to find the traits.

6.	Project 5- NFL Player Statistics: In this project I collected the data from 3 different sources- Kaggle, and API and web scraping. Then I combined the data and created 10 different visualizations on it.

7.	Project 6- Gearbox Failure Prediction: In this project I created a prediction model for the failure of gearbox. I trained a model and then used it to predict the failure of gearbox based on the downloaded time series data on 4 vibration sensors placed in four different directions, and under variation of load from '0' to '90' percent.

8.	Project 7.1- Wind Turbine Anomaly Prediction: In this project I used IsolationForest and One-Class SVM models to predict anomalies. I created scatterplots of the results to easily identify the best performing model. The data I used was not labeled and this wass an unsupervised prediction model.

9.	Project 7.2- Wind Turbine Anomaly Prediction_Presentation: This project was the presentation of the anomaly detection model on wind turbines, where I explained different aspects of it.

10.	Project 7.3- Wind Turbine Anomaly Prediction_Video: This project was creating a video on the anomaly models and my findings.

11.	Project 8.1- Air Travel Safety Visualization_Executive Summary: This is an executive summary of visualizations created on Tableau to highlight that air travel is the safest mode of transportation despite the negative media reporting.

12.	Project 8.2- Is Air Travel Safe: This is a presentation on compilation of visualizations created on Tableau to highlight that air travel is the safest mode of transportation despite the negative media reporting.

13.	Project 9- Equipment Failure Prediction: 1st project from this course (DSC680): This project is to predict failures in equipment using the logistic regression method.

14.	Project 10- Air Compressor: Anomaly Prediction: This project is to predict anomalies in machines so that appropriate action could be taken to prevent them.

15.	Project 11- Jet Engine RUL Prediction: This project is to predict the remaining useful life of jet engine.
